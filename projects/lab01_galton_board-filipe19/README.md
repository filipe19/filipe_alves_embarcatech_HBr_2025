# **Digital Galton Board**

## Problem Setup

In an idealized Galton board, like the one shown in Figure 1, a ball bounces off a single pin in each row of the board. When the ball hits a pin, it has a 50% chance of bouncing left and a 50% chance of bouncing right. In this idealization, the outcome of each bounce is completely independent of the previous ones.

*Figure 1. Overview of the Galton Board (Source: [V. Hunter Adams](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Galton/Galton.html#Introduction))*

A set of bins collects the balls as they fall through the bottom row of the board. We can label these bins starting from the left with increasing integers beginning at 0. The number of bins equals one more than the number of rows in the Galton Board.
The ball drops onto the top center pin, at a position that is half the number of rows. For example, in the 5-row Galton Board shown above, the ball starts at position 2.5. Each collision with a pin has a 50% chance to increase the position by 0.5 (right bounce) and a 50% chance to decrease it by 0.5 (left bounce). The bin it eventually lands in represents the sum of *N* such random trials, where *N* is the number of rows.

## What Is a Galton Board?

It's a physical device that demonstrates how small random decisions lead to a **normal (Gaussian) distribution** when repeated many times (like randomly choosing to go left or right after a bounce).

**Why digital?**
I transformed this concept into an interactive simulator, where we can adjust parameters in real time and instantly see the results.

This project implements a **digital version** of the **Galton Board** using the Raspberry Pi Pico with the **BitDogLab** kit. The simulation lets you **visually observe in real time** the statistical behavior of particles colliding with fixed pins and accumulating in bins, illustrating concepts such as **binomial distribution**, the **Central Limit Theorem**, and the **Law of Large Numbers**.

## Components and Architecture

**Hardware Used:**

* Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi Pico (ARM Cortex-M0+), based on the RP2040
* Display: OLED 128x64 (I2C)
* Controls: 2 buttons (GPIO 5, 6)

*Photo of BitDogLab and, in the background, the VSCode development environment.*

**Code Architecture (C):**

1. **Initialization:** Sets up GPIO, I2C, and display
2. **Physics Simulation:** Updates ball positions and collisions
3. **Rendering:** Draws everything pixel-by-pixel on the OLED using the library in the `inc` folder
4. **Controls:** Buttons A and B, adjusting parameters in real time

## Practical Operation

### Randomness and Collisions

* Each ball starts at the center of the top track
* On hitting a pin, it randomly bounces left or right
* Bias can be adjusted via Button B (0 = always left, 5 = 50%, 10 = always right)

### Counting and Distribution

* Balls fall into bottom bins, forming a histogram
* Auto-normalization: Graph resizes to fit the display

### Multiple Simultaneous Balls

* Button A controls how many balls are released per cycle (1 to 5)
* Demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers in practice

---

## Why Is This Project Special?

**Theory meets practice:**
It combines probability theory with embedded systems implementation.

**Technical challenge:**
All graphic processing is done pixel-by-pixel on the microcontroller.

**Interactivity:**
Real-time control of simulation parameters.
