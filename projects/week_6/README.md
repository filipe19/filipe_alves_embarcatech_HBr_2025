- In addition to studying **Microcontroller Architectures and Manufacturers**, we also worked on practical implementations, such as:

## **Project List**  

| Project | Description |  
|---------|------------|  
| [Project_1: **Countdown Timer with Event Logging via Interrupts**](https://github.com/filipe19/filipe_alves_embarcatech_HBr_2025/tree/main/projects/week_6/decrementing_count) | This implementation included a **software-based debounce solution for button input**. The debounce was handled using a waiting period (`delay`) based on the `absolute_time_diff_us` function to ensure that a minimum interval (defined as 300 ms via `DEBOUNCE_TIME_MS`) had passed since the last button press. This approach prevented multiple rapid presses caused by mechanical or electrical noise from being incorrectly registered as valid clicks during the countdown interval.|
